## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax, Pokemon.api

## Approach Taken
The user is able to click on a generation and it shows all the pokemon from that generation.
The buttons are created from data from the api. Meaning the website should auto update when new generations are added.

The user can then click on the pokemon name and see more information about the pokemon (just the type right now).

The user can also search any pokemon by their name or ID and it shows the pokemon and its information.

## Unsolved Problems
I did the pokemon by name instead of ID, in the api I used sometimes the name doesn't match exactly so the img does not appear. I fixed this by giving it a broken image. However, you can still look that pokemon up by ID.
To actually fix this I would have to re-write and use a different part of the api and go by the pokemon ID instead of by the pokemon name.
