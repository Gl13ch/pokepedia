# Pok√©pedia
Beaker Project One

#Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery, Ajax

#Approach Taken
The user is able to click on a generation and it shows all the pokemon from that generation.
The user can then click on the pokemon name and see more information about the pokemon (just the type right now).

The user can also search any pokemon by their name or ID and it shows the pokemon and its information.

#Unsolved Problems
I had trouble figuring out giving the pokemon that have multiple types more then one type.
I wanted to add more information to each pokemon.
